\begin{abstract}
In recent years, there are more and more recommendation systems merged as time goes on. It brought us a lot of convenience and improved the efficiency of finding resources by the development of technology. However, with the rapid growth of information, people feel hard to find the exact information they need in job searching sometimes. Thus, the birth of Job Recommendation satisfied the demand of finding exact job information as soon as possible and make this process more and more automatically. So, in this project, we will explore the system of Job recommendation to help people improve the efficiency in finding job information.

\section{Introduction}

As we browse the internet nowadays, we realized that many websites push side advertisements that are related to what we have just browsed seconds ago. We were wondering how the internet has gotten so smart, yet it was a trick that many technology companies have made use of to better sort through the data they have about users and to generate profits more efficiently. These companies use data to filter out things that users like to read, which enhance users' browsing experience and therefore, use the website more often. The so-called recommendation system has been more and more popular and is now an integral part of many e-commerce sites such as Netflix, Amazon.com, Google, and etc. While these big commercial companies have been using the recommendation system for so long, we also want to analyze how some job websites can utilize this recommendation system to enhance user experience. 
\par According to Wikipedia's definition, a recommendation system  is a subclass of the information filtering system that seeks to forecast and predict the "preference" or "rating" that users would give to an item. In terms of a job recommendation system, it is the criteria of  "interesting and useful" and "individualized" that separate the recommendation system from traditional search engine and information retrieval systems. It is more personalized for users that they could easily find the information they need without future clicks and research.
\par the regards of job recommendation systems, we want the system to recommend related job ads to job seekers based on their click history and basic information that they inserted in into the website such as majors, work history, extracurricular activities, skill sets, and etc. In other words, a job recommendation system has no difference than an automated form of a job search agency that not only it will show you a list of jobs that might fit you based on your information, but it will also utilized the relative jobs that related users have gotten or interested in who share the similar backgrounds as you do. The system is well trained in upselling and cross selling, just like an integrated job search agency. The fact that the job recommendation system could recommend personalized content based on past experience and related users' information bring users back to the website and keep using it. 


\section{Importance of Job Recommendation Systems}
With the rapid development of the Internet in the world, people's lifestyle has undergone tremendous changes. In the past, people may need to look for employment information by reading newspapers and reading magazines. But nowadays, people's lifestyles are changed. They are more and more inseparable from the Internet, and more and more work information is directly put online. People start to search for jobs online as a more direct and convenient way. According to data from China Internet Network Information Center, as of 2014, the number of Internet users in China has reached 632 million. As a result, optimizing network information has become an increasingly important demand. Because, with the development of the network, the amount of information increased more rapidly. However, the ability of people to choose information can not keep up with the explosive growth of information, which leads to a huge conflict between information growth and information selection ability of people. consequently, how to make this process more efficient by designing a system is become more and more important.On the other hand, the rapid development of the Internet brings us into a new era of big data. On the Internet, there are more and more different types of jobs, different types of requirements. Job seekers often spend a lot of time to search and browse jobs information, however, they may still will do something that is not their ideal position. Therefore, how to help job seekers intelligently to find the information they want in a short time has significant meaning at the time.


\section{Recommendation Techniques}
According to Resnick, P. and Varian, H.'s ‘Recommender Systems’. Communications of the ACM, they mentioned that recommendation techniques have many possible classifications. It is not about the types of interfaces and the properties of users' interaction with the job recommendation systems, but it is more about the sources of data that the system is based on and also the use to which the data is put. More specifically, a job recommendation system need to contain (i) background data, the information which the
system retains before the job recommendation process starts, (ii) input data, the information which user must communicate to the system in order to generate a recommendation, for example,majors, work history, extracurricular activities, skill sets, and etc, and (iii) an algorithm that combines input and background data to arrive at its suggestions.


\section{Definition of Important Terms}
Collaborative systems often deploy a nearest neighbor method or a item-based collaborative filtering system – a simple system that makes recommendations based on simple regression or a weighted-sum approach. The end goal of collaborative systems is to make recommendations based on customers’ behavior, purchasing patterns, and preferences, as well as product attributes, price ranges, and product categories. Content-based systems can deploy methods as simple as averaging, or they can deploy advanced machine learning approaches in the form of Naive Bayes classifiers,  clustering algorithms or artificial neural nets.

\subsection{Collaborative filtering algorithms}
In order to understand how a job recommendation system work, we need to understand different recommendation systems approaches in order to pick the one that fit our need the most. Collaborative filtering methods are based on a large section of collecting and analyzing information on users' activities, preferences and forecasting what job seekers will like based on similar job seekers who share similar background. One of an important advantages of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore, it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as a data science job without requiring and "understanding" of the job itself. Many algorithms are used in measuring item similarity and user similarity in recommendation systems. 
\par Collaborative filtering algorithms are based on the assumptions that most of the people who agreed in the past will later agree in the future, and that they will tend to like similar types of items as they liked in the past.
\par When we are building a model from users' behaviors, we need to make a distinction between implicit and explicit forms of data collection.

\par Examples of the collection of implicit data could be be the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Observing the jobs that users view in the past.
  \item Analyzing job/user viewing times.
  \item Keeping a record of the jobs that users apply online.
  \item Obtaining a list of jobs that users have read to or researched on their computers.
  \item Analyzing the users' social network and discovering similar likes and dislikes.
\end{itemize}


\par Examples of the collection of explicit data could be be the following:
 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Asking users to rate an job on a number scale.
  \item Asking users to search.
  \item Asking users to make a rank of a collection of jobs from favorite to least favorite.
  \item Presenting two jobs to users and asking them to choose one of the better in between the two.
  \item Asking  users to come up with a list of jobs that they like.
\end{itemize}

\par The job recommendation system will compare the implicit and explicit data to similar and dissimilar data collected from outside resources and calculates a list of recommended jobs for the users. 

\par Collaborative filtering methods often have these three drawbacks which are cold start, sparsity, and scalability.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Cold start: These recommendation systems often require a great amount of pre-existing data on users in order to make some accurate recommendations. That means, if the data of one user is not comprehensive enough, there is a great possibility that the recommendation by the system does not align with the user's interest
  \item Sparsity: The number of jobs posted on major job search sites is extremely large. The most involved and active users will only rate a small subset of the entire database. With that being said, even the most popular jobs will only have very few ratings.
  \item Scalability: In many of the system environments in that these recommendation systems make recommendations, there are over millions of users and jobs, which means a large amount of computation power is definitely required and necessary to calculate all of the recommendations for all the users.

\end{itemize}

\par Collaborative filtering approaches are classified as model based and memory-based collaborative filtering. A well-known example of memory-based approaches is user-based algorithm and that of model-based approaches is Kernel-Mapping Recommender.


\subsection{Content-based filtering algorithms}
Another popular approach that data scientists like to use to design job recommendation systems is content-based filtering. Content-based filtering approaches are based on profiles of the users’ preferences and a description of the job item. In a content-based recommendation system, keywords are implemented to describe the jobs and users' profiles are built to indicate the types of jobs these users like. To put in a different way, this algorithm tries to recommend jobs that are similar to those that users viewed and liked in the past. In particular, various potential jobs are put together to compare with jobs previously rated by the users and the best-matching jobs are recommended. This particular approach has its origins in information filtering research and information retrieval.

\par To epurate the features of the jobs in the recommendation system, an job presentation algorithm would be applied. A widely popular used algorithm is the tf–idf representation.

\par To create a user profile and save it in the database, the recommendation system mostly wants to focus on two kinds of information:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A model of the users' preferences.
  \item A history of the users' interactions with the recommendation system.
\end{enumerate}

\par Generally, these methods use an job profile characterizing the job within the recommendation system. The system will create content-based profiles of users based on the item features. There might be different weights to every item in terms of users' preference. The weights that are assigned to each of the features depending on the users' preference can be computed and calculated from individually rated content using a series of techniques. Simple approach uses the average rates of the item vector while other sophisticated approaches use machine learning techniques such as cluster analysis, Bayesian Classifiers, artificial neural networks and decision trees to calculate or estimate the potential probability that the users are going to like the job.

\par The feedback the system got directly from a user, usually in the form of a like or dislike button, can be used to allocate lower or higher weights on the importance of specific attributes.

\par An significant drawback with content-based filtering is that whether the recommendation system is actually capable to learn user preferences from users' historical actions regarding content sources and use the sources across all the other content types. When the recommendation system is limited to recommending jobs of the same types that the user is currently using, the retrieved value from the system is significantly less than that when another content type from other retrieving services could be recommended. For instance, recommending current news articles based on historical browsing of news is definitely useful, but it would be more useful when products, music, videos, discussions and etc. from different retrieving services could be recommended based on the news browsing.

\par A great example of content-based filtering approach being used in the real world is Pandora Radio. It plays music based on the user's initial feed to the recommendation system and deliver recommended music with similar characteristics. Besides that, most of the movie, music, and book recommendation systems are based on content-based filtering algorithm since this particular one works the best for personalization based on historical data.


\subsection{Hybrid recommendation systems}
Recent researches have demonstrated that hybrid approaches, combining both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering could be much more effective in many cases. Hybrid approaches could be implemented in the following ways: by adding collaborative-based approach to a content-based capabilities , or vice versa; by collaborative-based making and content-based predictions separately and later combining them; or by unifying both approaches into one integrated model. Recent studies empirically compare the performance of the hybrid recommendation systems with the pure collaborative and content-based methods and thus demonstrate that the hybrid approaches can provide much more accurate recommendations than the pure approaches. These approaches can also be used to overcome many of the common problems that happen in pure approach recommendation systems such as sparsity and the scalability problem.

\par One of the examples of the use of hybrid recommendation systems is Netflix. Although many movie and music recommendation systems use pure content-based approaches, Netflix chooses the strong hybrid approach that makes recommendations by using collaborative filtering, comparing the searching and watching behaviors of similar users as well as by content-based filtering, offering shows and movies which share similar characteristics with content that users have highly rated.

\par A variety numbers of techniques have been proposed as the fundamentals for recommendation systems: content-based, collaborative, demographic and knowledge-based techniques. Every single one of these techniques has some sort of drawbacks, such as the well-known scalability problem for collaborative approach and biased rating system for content-based systems. A hybrid recommendation system is one that integrates multiple techniques together in order to achieve some synergy between all of the approaches, minimizing the influences of those drawback from a specific method.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Content-based: The system generates recommendations from particularly two sources: the ratings that a user has given them and the features associated with products. Content-based recommendation system treats recommendations as user-specific classification problems and learns a classifier for the users' likes and dislikes based on item features, which in our case, the job features.
  \item Collaborative: The system provides recommendations using exclusively information about the rating profiles from different users or jobs. Collaborative system locates similar users / jobs with rating histories similar to the incumbent user or job and generate recommendations using the neighborhood. The users based and the items based nearest neighbor algorithms can be integrated to deal with the cold start problem and thus, improve recommendation results.
  \item Knowledge-based: A knowledge-based recommendation system suggests jobs based on inferences about users' preferences and needs. This knowledge will contain explicit functional information about how certain job features would meet user needs.
  \item Demographic: A demographic recommendation system generates recommendations based on a demographic profile of the users. Recommended jobs can be retrieved for different demographic niches, combining the ratings of users in those niches.
\end{itemize}


\section{How to Implement recommendation System}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item  User information acquisition and modeling: Because users have different interests and different industry differences, so we need to deal with the log files, dig out the user's explicit and implicit requirements, and then analyze and build the user mold.
  \item Model Design and Implementation: At this stage, the main contents include the combination of feature variables, similarity calculation, positive and negative samples of mobile phones, weight value calculation and knowledge classification logistic regression.
  \item System Design and Implementation: The user model and big data platform combine to meet the needs of the company's job recommendation system.
  \item System verification and comparison: The group calculates the conversion rate off-line, determines the characteristic variable combination and the similar algorithm of the recommended model, and uses the filtering recommendation algorithm to compare and verify to get the optimal combination recommendation system.
  \item The application and research of the system: It is necessary to establish the application framework of the recommendation system in other application fields, to study how to integrate with other business systems of the enterprise and to realize the diversification of the recommendation system.

\end{enumerate}



\section{Design System Model}
As a kind of data mining, recommendation system is one of the more special data mining systems. He embodies the system and user interaction and real-time. Recommend interest-based objects to users based on their hobbies or browsing behaviors, and further correct and optimize the recommendation results based on the feedback results of user interaction. In this professional recommendation system, there are mainly three parts, data collection, offline data processing and real-time online recommendation.

\subsection{Data collection}
In the process of data collection. Because there are many ways for users to provide their preference information to the system, they can be divided into two kinds of explicit and implicit information. This information forms the basis of user behavior analysis. In this project, the main sources and channels of data are information about job-seekers registering, browsing jobs, and weblogging for job postings. User behavior categories: registration, browsing, residence time, job application. Their respective types of information are: explicit, implicit, implicit, implicit. The following is an explanation of the characteristics and actions of the four user behaviors.
\par Registration: job seekers registered behavior, including the basic characteristics of job seekers, registration information we can get job preferences,
Through job seekers' preferences, we can get more precise career preferences.
\par Browse: job seekers on the job browsing information, through the frequency of the frequency of statistics, job seekers get the preference. This process can to some extent reflect their concern about job postings and the likelihood that they will be interested in positions. Thereby enhancing the accuracy of the analysis
\par Dwell time: The user's dwell time information analysis, you can know whether the user is interested in the content of the visit and the degree of concern, so as to get their preference information. The longer you stay on a page, the more likely they are to be interested in the content of the page, as well as the level of attention. However, there are occasional noise data that is difficult to use based on this standard.
\par Job Application: Boolean preferences, the value is 0 and 1. This information can be used to determine whether the user is interested in this position.

\subsection{Offline data processing}
Generally, the historical data of job seekers will be very large. Therefore, if the system wants to analyze massive data online and recommend it in real time, it is unrealistic. Therefore, if offline processing of data can make the data processing more Efficient and easy to implement. When we have collected enough user behavior data, we can pre-process the data off-line, such as noise reduction, and then analyze the user's behavior log and train user profiles through recommendation strategies. Finally, offline calculation of the user's character data and get the initial recommendation seen, the next step, the recommended results provided to the online implementation of the recommended use.

\subsection{Online real-time recommendation}
The online real-time recommendation is to analyze the user's real-time behavior in a very short period of time and give the recommended result. Therefore, the online recommendation system and offline processing are two different processes and concepts. The online real-time recommendation can not process the user's historical behavior log and can not handle too complicated data. The online real-time recommendation usually deals with simple data, for example, querying the basic information of job seekers, job seekers applying, And then combine the result of the analysis with the user characteristic data that has been processed offline to get the final recommendation result to the job seekers through the multi-dimensional analysis of filtering, screening and recommendation ranking.


\section{Technical Model}

\subsection{Similarity retrieval technology}
Content similarity retrieval technology refers to comparing the text feature information in a resource with the text feature value of a user's interest, comparing the user's historical preference information with the content feature of a resource, and calculating the similarity , Filtered out to meet the user's search expectations. An example of content similarity retrieval technology. First, you need to model the content and attributes of your position, for example, by industry, function, job type, and place of employment. And then through the characteristics of each position data to find the similarity between positions. If the professions, functions, types of jobs and workplaces are the same, we can think of these two posts as similar.

\subsection{Demographic Collaborative Recommender Technology}
Demographic information can be viewed as a kind of user knowledge information that can be used to determine similar equivalence across networks, so that demographic information can be considered as a synergistic approach. Collaborative demographic recommendation process: First, establish a data model for job seekers. Then according to job seekers model to calculate the similarity between job seekers. Find job seekers with the highest degree of similarity. Finally, recommend jobs to current job candidates based on their preferences. As a result, demographic data can initiate a referral system even when job seekers do not have a feedback evaluation of the position.

\subsection{Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Techniques}
Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Techniques is a technique that is widely used to predict user interest preferences. Its basic principle is based on the user's preference for the object, found the relevance of the object or user, and then recommend based on these correlations. The recommendation of collaborative filtering consists of three components: they are, Item-based recommendation, user-based recommendation and model-based recommendation. In this project, we mainly study this work recommendation system based on the idea of collaborative recommendation. That is to say, we need to train the recommendation model based on the sample data of job seekers' preferences and then make predictions based on the real-time information of job seekers Calculate recommended.

\subsection{Big data processing technology}
In this professional recommendation system, we assume that the big data processing framework that we need to use is log acquisition system Flume, big data platform Hadoop, streaming computing framework Storm and message cache system Kafka.

\par Below I will introduce these different frameworks.


\subsubsection{Flume}
Flume is a distributed, reliable, and highly available mass log collection, aggregation and delivery system. In this project, we anticipate that all the real-time input data needed will be realized through this technology platform. An Agent is the basic component of a Flume stream. An Agent contains Source, Channel, Sinks, and other components that use these components to pass an Event from one node to the next or for the final purpose. The data is finally encapsulated into an Event for transmission. The Source is used to accept an external source. For example, the Apache server delivers an Event to the source. The channel is used to temporarily store the Event. Sink then outputs the data. Other components can add pretreatment and classification capabilities.

\subsubsection{Hadoop}
At present, the large number of user data are obtained based on the site log records, job site for very large number of users, a simple single machine is difficult to complete offline data processing, so this project will be presumably we have introduced a distributed Framework to deal with, Hadoop is one of the most popular distributed framework today, which includes the distributed file system HDFS and distributed computing framework MapReduce and so on.
